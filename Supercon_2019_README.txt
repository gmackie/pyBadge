Welcome to EDGE BADGE CircuitPython and Machine Learning!
#############################

Hello Hackaday Superconference!

What you have in your hand is an Adafruit multi-mode EDGE BADGE with 
special thanks to Digi-Key for making it possible for 500 of these to 
make it to the event!
	https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400

This device is a Python-powered name badge out out-of-the-box 
(just edit code.py to personalize!)  AND it's also a BRAINCRAFT 
machine learning badge that runs TensorFlow lite for microncontrollers. 
This is real machine learning on the edge, and it's wearable!

THANK YOU Dig-Key!
	https://www.digikey.com/

This hardware comes pre-loaded with CircuitPython! 
CircuitPython is Adafruit's branch of MicroPython designed to 
simplify experimentation and education on low-cost microcontrollers. 
It makes it easier than ever to get  prototyping by requiring no 
upfront desktop software downloads.

With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python 3 code to 
control hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages 
like C or C++ (what Arduino uses for programming). 
It's great for beginners and is powerful for experts.

On the device there are images and code to get started:

code.py  is the slideshow that runs the badge code, edit the name and 
URL to personalize it.

supercon.bmp is the bitmap image you can change to whatever you'd like 
160 x 128 pixels.

Whichever file is named "code.py" is the one that runs, change the name 
to change the program. Once saved the device automatically restarted 
and runs that code!

Enjoy Hackaday Superconference!

Thanks!
  - the Adafruit team

*ONE MORE THING - here is a special discount code for attendees at 
hackaday supercon, it's 10% off in the Adafruit store, enjoy!

The EDGE BADGE has limited disk space so we have disabled Mac OS X 
indexing which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, 
.metadata_never_index or .Trashes files!

CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing code.py in your favorite code 
or text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and 
comes with a built in REPL serial viewer! 
It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux

	https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor/
	https://codewith.mu/

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the 
latest code.

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information,
better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the 
REPL). On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 

On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.
